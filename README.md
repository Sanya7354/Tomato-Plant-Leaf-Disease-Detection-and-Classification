# Tomato-Plant-Leaf-Disease-Detection-and-Classification
In this project we have used a neural network-based procedure for dis- ease identification as well as for classification. The generic CNN model  and VGG-16 is used for disease detection and classification of tomato leaf And at last compare the accuracy of the model.
